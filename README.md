# Library-Book-Management-System

Online Library Management System is a system which maintains the information
about the books present in the library, their authors, the members of library to
whom books are issued, library staff and all. This is very difficult to organize
manually. Maintenance of all this information manually is a very complex task.

members, book issues and returns and all other operations. This computerization of
library helps in many instances of its maintenances. It reduces the workload of
management as most of the manual work done is reduced
